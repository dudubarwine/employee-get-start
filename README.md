In this project I will go through the best practices for typescript react development.

My main focus is to make sure that the application is developed and tested before deploying
and version controlling the application.

Inspired by my current work place the Dudu Bar & Wine
Ive faced few challenges on the procedure of requiting new employees and keep track of the necessary forms that need to be filled.
So I decided to make a single landing page that contains forms for all the different data that i need from my employee's.
